# BlockChain‑LinuxExercise

This repository contains a set of educational exercises combining Linux scripting and C++ implementations to explore basic blockchain principles.

- **blockchain1.sh** – Shell‑based introduction, e.g. generating hashes or interacting with Linux tools.
- **ex1.cpp–ex5.cpp** – Five incremental C++ programs that build on each other, possibly covering data structures (blocks, chains), hashing, validation, etc.
- **infra.cpp/infra.h** – Shared utilities to support the exercises (e.g., file I/O, hashing helpers).
- **Makefile** – Compilation script for easy building and running of the C++ codebase.
